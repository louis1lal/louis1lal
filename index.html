    <h2>Welcome to my official website!</h2>
    <p>PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Please come again later! </p>
    <p>For as long as I remember, I've always been interested by arts, sciences and creation. As a teenager I started a music band and then my interest switched for audio recording. Later, I started drawing, 3d and other forms of CG art. Now, my goal is to be able to work as a freelancer to be able to live off of what is really important to me. I'll always keep working on my skills and try to do better thant the previous one. I hope to meet you soon guys!

Have a wonderful day!</p>
